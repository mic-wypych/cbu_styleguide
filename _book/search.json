This ensures more uniform and consistent look and feel across all visualizations in cbu reports. It also lists a bunch of things (especially related to accessibility) that should be considered when making plots and tables. Additionally the idea is to reduce the burden of designing and making choices when creating plots. Ultimately the all functionalities related to making cbu-styled plots and reports should end up in the {cbuR} package.\nIn more details the things discussed are:",

This means ensuring that text is readable, does no overlap but also thinking about colors with regard to black-white scale and colorblindness.\nPlots should have consistent styling. Don’t switch between types\nPlots should use shapes that display information in as readable way as possible (e.g. when showing changes in time line plots are often better than bar plots).\nRules are not hard-coded. Sometimes using specific colors (e.g. some political parties have official colors) might be more appropriate than sticking to the official color palette. In such cases always consult other team members.\nCharts and tables should be referenced text. Specific guidelines are provided in tutorial on the report format. This matters both for readability and apparently is a quarto quirk with {tinytable} package used for rendering tables.\nWe do not use titles for plots.",

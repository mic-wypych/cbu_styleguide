## tutorial

This chapter is a walkthrough the report template. It's aim is to present each part of the report and show how to use it to write and render a ready cbu report.

### General structure of the report

When you get/download a directory with the report template you should see the following structure (to be cleaned later:

```{r eval=FALSE}
cbu_report
├── template.amd
├── cbu_report.rproj
└── _extensions
    └── cbu_format_typst
        ├── logo.png
        ├── Open_Sans
        ├── typst-show.typ
        ├── typst-template.typ
        └── _extension.yml
├── cbulogo-nobg.png
├── cover_rect_ggdist.png
```

The file `template.qmd` is the report template where all the work will happen. `cbu_report.rproj` is the R project file that allows us to work on R project level which makes many things easier. The `_extensions` folder contains fonts, logos as well as typst files that map the information from `template.qmd` to typst and then render in proper format to pdf. DO NOT TOUCH that folder. The remaining files contain the cbu logo and report cover.

### Brief introduction to quarto

In case you have not worked with quarto before it is a multi-language version of R markdown which allows to combine code and text in a single file. You can find excellent documentation [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) and a youtube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f3latmOhew). In order to be able to work with the template you will need to download and install quarto and some editor like rstudio or positron.

When you open the `template.qmd` you will see something like this:

The top left pane is where the report template is. the top part of it is the yaml header where information like report title, date and authors are included. Below the header is the proper report with text and code chunks. In the same part on the right side is a table of contents based on headers. At the top of this pane you can find some basic text formatting tools like inserting images, links, inserting elements like code chunks, bullet lists etc. The rest is the regular Rstudio look.

### Tech stack

We use quarto for writing and combining text and code. The computations themselves can be done in R, Python or Julia. Rendering to pdf is handled by Typst and citations are made with Zotero.

### Walkthrough

Below you will see a basic walkthrough of making a simple report. We'll go through setting the general information in the header, writing and formatting text, adding code chunks for calculations, tables and plots and adding references

#### Yaml header

The first thing to fill when making a report is the so called YAML header. It's the top part of the `template.qmd` denoted by `---`. The information you have to put here are the title of the report, date and authors with their affiliations.

-   add video/printscreen

#### Writing text

Working with Rstudio/Positron makes it easy to write text in visual mode which roughly should resemble the basics of programs like Word.

-   add video showing example of text:

    -   simple text

    -   main points on page 2

    -   bullet lists, etc

    -   subtitles/headings

    -   footnotes

#### Computations

Any computations have to be included in the so called code chunks. You can add them manually or with `ctrl` + `alt` + `i`.

-   add video with examples

    -   computations

    -   plots + labels and captions

    -   tables + labels and captions

#### References

By default the report relies on Zotero which is nicely integrated with RStudio but you can manually edit/create a reference.bib file. Tables and Figures are also references in text.

-   add video

    -   Zotero citations

    -   Cross referencing tables and

#### Rendering

Once the report is ready it is time to render it! You can do it with the render button.

-   add a video

This part deals with all text-related things in the format. Both in terms of typography and some rules about general writing

### Table showing all font sizes, families etc.

put the table here

Are there any additional rules about text?

Probably something like:

-   avoid very long titles

-   avoid very long headings

-   make sure text does not overlap -\> `{ggrepel}`

-   ensure proper contrast for text -\> `{ggfittext}`

General rules about writing should go here?

-   Be accessible... Don't wirte about logits. Opt for Average MArginal Effects in percentages instead. If possible try to get a sense of scale and some interpretation for the effects

-   But remain scientific. Be precise, don't overstate - this is scientific writing.

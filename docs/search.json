Those are pretty common in cbu reports for showing and comparing means or counts. Some general rules to follow here are:\n\nif possible add text above the bars\nmake the bars a bit thinner than default ggplot behaviour\nUnless necessary don’t use multiple colors\n\nHere is an example of a cbu styled bar plot showing some means:\n\nbar_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    category = letters[1:7],\n    means = round(rnorm(7, 6, 1.5), 2)\n)\n\nbar_df %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = category, y = means)) +\ngeom_col(fill= cbu_cat_1[1], width = .6) +\ngeom_text(aes(label = means), nudge_y = .5) +\ntheme_cbu()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few more specific issues that often arise for bar plots:\n\nposition adjustments\nBar plot work best with position dodge. The only thing to remember is to set the width right and add the position adjustment to any additional geoms used in the plot.\n\nbar_df$category_2 &lt;- c(rep(\"a\", 3), rep(\"b\", 4))\n\nbar_df %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = category_2, y = means, fill = category)) +\ngeom_col(width = .6, position = position_dodge(width = .6)) +\ngeom_text(aes(label = means),position = position_dodge(width = .6), vjust = -1) +\nscale_fill_manual(values = cbu_cat) +\ntheme_cbu()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong labels:\nSometimes we might be working with very long labels for some categories. Those can be difficult to nicely render on a bar plot. 2 ways to deal with this is either to flip coordinates that often makes the labels more readable or to wrap them so that they will have fixed maximum length on a single line. In case of flipping coordinates you will need to adjust the grid lines as well\nOption 1:\n\ndf_long_labs &lt;- data.frame(\n    item = c(\"When I want to feel more positive emotion (such as joy or amusement), I change what I’m thinking about.\",\n            \"I keep my emotions to myself.\",\n            \"When I want to feel less negative emotion (such as sadness or anger), I change what I’m thinking about.\",\n            \"When I am feeling positive emotions, I am careful not to express them.\"),\n    mean = c(4.54, 2.34, 6.44, 3.55),\n    sd = c(0.67, 1.23, 1.12, 0.89)\n)\n\ndf_long_labs %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = item, y = mean)) +\ngeom_col(fill = cbu_cat_2[2], width = .6) +\ngeom_text(aes(label = mean), nudge_y = .5) +\ncoord_flip() +\ntheme_cbu() +\ntheme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n     panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"grey80\", linewidth = .5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2:\n\ndf_long_labs &lt;- data.frame(\n    item = c(\"When I want to feel more positive emotion (such as joy or amusement), I change what I’m thinking about.\",\n            \"I keep my emotions to myself.\",\n            \"When I want to feel less negative emotion (such as sadness or anger), I change what I’m thinking about.\",\n            \"When I am feeling positive emotions, I am careful not to express them.\"),\n    mean = c(4.54, 2.34, 6.44, 3.55),\n    sd = c(0.67, 1.23, 1.12, 0.89)\n)\n\ndf_long_labs %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = str_wrap(item, 40), y = mean)) +\ngeom_col(fill = cbu_cat_2[2], width = .6) +\ngeom_text(aes(label = mean), nudge_y = .5) +\ncoord_flip() +\ntheme_cbu() +\ntheme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n     panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"grey80\", linewidth = .5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadding errorbars:\n\ndf_long_labs %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = item, y = mean)) +\ngeom_col(fill = cbu_cat_2[2], width = .6) +\ngeom_errorbar(aes(x = str_wrap(item, 40), ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd), width = .2) +\ntheme_cbu()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsome likert-scale related issues:\ngeom_bar() will always by default start the plots from 0. This is generally good behavior but in case of likert scale items we often want them to start from 1. The best way to adjsut this is via coord_cartesian() and setting the ylim argument.\n\ndf_long_labs %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = str_wrap(item, 40), y = mean)) +\ngeom_col(fill = cbu_cat_2[2], width = .6) +\ngeom_text(aes(label = mean), nudge_y = .5) +\ncoord_cartesian(ylim=c(1,7)) +\ntheme_cbu()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2 Filled bar charts\nWe use those usually for displaying percentages (e.g. distribution of answers to a likert scale type question). Specific issues that often arise with these kinds of plots are related to very small categories. When trying to show text for those categories it can be difficult to get non-overlappling and readable labels. Some ways to deal with this is to collapse categories if possible or use {ggrepel} to push text.\n\ndf_cat &lt;- data.frame(\n    cat_1 = sample(letters[1:4], 1e3, replace = TRUE),\n    cat_2 = sample(letters[5:7], 1e3, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.01, .6, .39))\n)\n\ndf_cat %&gt;%\ncount(cat_1, cat_2) %&gt;%\ngroup_by(cat_1) %&gt;%\nmutate(perc =n/sum(n)) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = cat_1, y = perc, fill = cat_2)) +\ngeom_col(width = .6) +\ngeom_text_repel(aes(label = scales::percent(perc)), position = position_stack(.5), direction = \"y\") +\nscale_fill_manual(values = cbu_cat_2[c(1,2,4)]) +\ntheme_cbu()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.3 Line charts\nLine charts are usually best suited for showing changes in time. One thing that sometimes comes up is a large number of lines that an make the plot unreadable. If possible we can then try to highlight just one (or a few) category and keep the rest in grey.\ndf_lines &lt;- data.frame(\n    date = rep(c(2012,2013,2014,2015, 2016), 5),\n    category = sort(rep(letters[1:5],5)),\n    value = rnorm(25)\n)\n\ndf_lines %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x=date, y = value, color = category)) +\ngeom_line(linewidth = 1.4) +\nscale_color_manual(values = cbu_cat_2) +\ntheme_cbu()\n\n\n5.0.4 Scatterplots\nUse cases are pretty obvious. The thing to remember is to deal with overlapping points either by setting transparency, using geom_count() or adding jitter.\n\ndf_scatter &lt;- data.frame(\n    x = rnorm(1e3, 4, 1.2),\n    x_2 = rnorm(1e3, 1.2, 1.7),\n    cat = factor(rbinom(1e3, 1, .5))\n)\n\ndf_scatter$y &lt;- rnorm(1e3, 2 + .5*df_scatter$x - .8*df_scatter$x_2 + .5*df_scatter$x*df_scatter$x_2, 1.4)\n\ndf_scatter %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = cat)) +\ngeom_count(alpha = .3) +\nscale_color_manual(values = cbu_cat_2) +\ntheme_cbu()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndealing with overplotting\nToo many points -&gt; go for geom_count?\nremember about reference line - geom_point will happily start the y axis from a number different from 0 or 1\n\n\n\n5.0.5 Line-of-best-fit charts\nThis in general refers to plots that show some kind of regression-like line of best fit, be it from a GLM, LOESS, GAM etc. Three things to remember about with these kinds of plots is to work with the model itself when plotting (rather than raw data), make sure a proper interpretation is provided and try to include uncertainty.\n\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(splines)\nfit_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    x = rnorm(1e3, 3.4, 1.2)\n)\nfit_df$y &lt;- rnorm(1e3, 1 + 3*sin(fit_df$x) - 1.2*cos(fit_df$x) + .2*fit_df$x^2, .6)\n\nmodel_fit &lt;- lm(y ~ ns(x, 3), fit_df)\n\nplot_predictions(model_fit, condition = \"x\") +\ngeom_point(data = fit_df, aes(x = x, y = y), alpha = .3) +\ntheme_cbu()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.6 Correlation plots?\nQuite commonly cbu reports graphically display correlations. One way which was commonly used was to make bar plots with heights of bar representing strength of the correlation. Some alternatives include dumbbell charts that use points instead of bars\n\ncor_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    cor = c(.44, .34, .21, .13, .11, -.23),\n    var = sort(rep(c(\"SDO\", \"RWA\", \"Identification\"), 2)),\n    group = rep(c(\"group a\", \"group b\"), 3)\n)\n\ncor_df %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(y = cor, x = var, fill = group)) +\ngeom_col(position = position_dodge(width = .9)) +\ngeom_text(aes(label = cor), position = position_dodge(width = .9), size = 5) +\ncoord_flip() +\nscale_fill_manual(values = cbu_cat_1) +\ntheme_cbu() +\ntheme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n     panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"grey80\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.7 Dumbbell charts\nDumbell charts are good for comparing changes or categories\n\ndf_dc &lt;- data.frame(\n    x = c(2020, 2024, 2020, 2024, 2020, 2024),\n    y = c(5.6, 3.4, 2.5, 5.1, 4.3, 4.8),\n    cat = c(\"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"c\", \"c\")\n)\n\ndf_dc %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = cat, y = y, color = factor(x))) +\ngeom_line(aes(group = cat), color = \"grey60\") +\ngeom_point(size = 3) +\ngeom_text(aes(label = y), nudge_x = .2) +\nscale_color_manual(values = cbu_cat_1) +\ncoord_flip() +\ntheme_cbu() +\ntheme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n     panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"grey80\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.8 Waffle charts\nWaffle charts can be used as alternative to bar charts for displaying counts or percentages. Preferrably they should also have numbers shown.\n\nlibrary(waffle)\n\ndf_cat %&gt;%\ncount(cat_1, cat_2) %&gt;%\nggplot(\n    aes(fill = cat_1, values = n)\n  ) +\n  geom_waffle(\n    n_rows = 20,\n    size = 0.33, \n    colour = \"white\",\n    flip = TRUE\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = NULL,\n    values = cbu_cat_2\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~cat_2, nrow = 1) +\n  coord_equal() +\n  theme_enhance_waffle() +\n  theme_cbu()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.9 Pie charts\njust no. Make a bar chart. Or a waffle chart\n\n\n5.0.10 Showing statistical models\nOne additional type of charts that sometimes appears in the reports are path diagrams showing path/SEM models. Unfortunately there isn’t really any good package for displaying path diagrams. IF you really want to make it in R you can use {ggdag} but all the nodes, positions and text has to be coded manually.\nYou can make such diagrams in Figma, diagram.net or Power Point. If you do that remember to use Open Sans font, preferrably size 12 or 14.",

    "text": "4.3 Table theming\nCbu report format works on typst which necessitates using {tinytable} package for making table as it is currently the only one that supports rendering in typst without problems. The main 2 types of tables used in cbu reports are ones containing primarily numbers (e.g. summary statistics, reporting model coefficients) and ones containing primarily text (e.g. item wording). Those can be styled a bit differently to fit conventions and the particular content.\n\n4.3.1 Tables with numbers\nThese tables include things like tables with sample characteristics (e.g. age, gender, education, place of living etc), summary statistics like means and standard deviations for important variables etc.\n\n\n4.3.2 Text tables\nThese tables include tables that primarily present text, especially when presenting scale items.\nissues:\n\nlong text\nmerging cells\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Model output tables\nThese tables include any statistical models presented in table format.\n\nwhich information should be included\ntext tables:\n\nissues: long text\nmerging cells\n\nmodel output tables:\n\ngeneral information that should be included in a table that describes a model are pretty much the same as standard APA stuff: include uncertainty (standard errors or confidence intervals)",

    "text": "This chapter is a walkthrough the report template. It’s aim is to present each part of the report and show how to use it to write and render a ready cbu report.\n\n6.0.1 General structure of the report\nWhen you get/download a directory with the report template you should see the following structure (to be cleaned later:\n\ncbu_report\n├── template.qmd\n├── cbu_report.rproj\n└── _extensions\n    └── cbu_format_typst\n        ├── logo.png\n        ├── Open_Sans\n        ├── typst-show.typ\n        ├── typst-template.typ\n        └── _extension.yml\n├── cbulogo-nobg.png\n├── cover_rect_ggdist.png\n\nThe file template.qmd is the report template where all the work will happen. cbu_report.rproj is the R project file that allows us to work on R project level which makes many things like managing paths easier. The _extensions folder contains fonts, logos as well as typst files that map the information from template.qmd to typst and then render in proper format to pdf. DO NOT TOUCH that folder. The remaining files contain the cbu logo and report cover.\n\n\n6.0.2 Brief introduction to quarto\nIn case you have not worked with quarto before it is a multi-language version of R markdown which allows to combine code and text in a single file. You can find excellent documentation here and a youtube tutorial here. In order to be able to work with the template you will need to download and install quarto and some editor like Rstudio or positron.\nWhen you open the template.qmd you will see something like this:\n\nThe top left pane is where the report template is. the top part of it is the yaml header where information like report title, date and authors are included. Below the header is the proper report with text and code chunks. In the same part on the right side is a table of contents based on headers. At the top of this pane you can find some basic text formatting tools like inserting images, links, inserting elements like code chunks, bullet lists etc. The rest is the regular Rstudio look.\n\n\n6.0.3 Tech stack\nWe use quarto for writing and combining text and code. The computations themselves can be done in R, Python or Julia. Rendering to pdf is handled by Typst and citations are made with Zotero. If you don’t know Zotero you can learn more and download here.\n\n\n6.0.4 Walkthrough\nBelow you will see a basic walkthrough of making a simple report. We’ll go through setting the general information in the header, writing and formatting text, adding code chunks for calculations, tables and plots and adding references\n\n6.0.4.1 Yaml header\nThe first thing to fill when making a report is the so called YAML header. It’s the top part of the template.qmd denoted by ---. The information you have to put here are the title of the report, date and authors with their affiliations.\n\nadd video/printscreen\n\n\n\n6.0.4.2 Writing text\nWorking with Rstudio/Positron makes it easy to write text in visual mode which roughly should resemble the basics of programs like Word.\n\nadd video showing example of text:\n\nsimple text\nmain points on page 2\nbullet lists, etc\nsubtitles/headings\nfootnotes\n\n\n\n\n6.0.4.3 Computations\nAny computations have to be included in the so called code chunks. You can add them manually or with ctrl + alt + i.\n\nadd video with examples\n\ncomputations\nplots + labels and captions\ntables + labels and captions\n\n\n\n\n6.0.4.4 References\nBy default the report relies on Zotero which is nicely integrated with RStudio but you can manually edit/create a reference.bib file. Tables and Figures are also references in text.\n\nadd video\n\nZotero citations\nCross referencing tables and\n\n\n\n\n6.0.4.5 Rendering\nOnce the report is ready it is time to render it! You can do it with the render button.\n\nadd a video",
